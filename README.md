It is the code for extracting the quantitative & local information of STEM ADF images of 2D TMDs material(V doped WSe2 and V doped MoS2) using deep neural network.
In 'main_test_model.ipynb' file, you can confirm the code in this project.

We cannot upload the training dataset for training the model and dynamic STEM images in this research bacause the file size are too big to upload this site.
If you want it, please contact Prof.Young-Min Kim (youngmk@skku.edu) for files.
